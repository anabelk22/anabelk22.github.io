<h1>St. Barths</h1>

<p>St. Barths is one of my favorite places to travel to because it is a really pretty beachy area in the Caribbean. Even though it is a pretty small island, it has beaches and restraunts like Bonito which is one of my favorite restaurants. They also have a similar restaurant in Aspen called Betula. 	</p>
