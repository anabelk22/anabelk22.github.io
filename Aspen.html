<h1>Aspen, CO</h1>

<p>Aspen is one of my favorite places to travel to because it is fun all-year-round. It's a small town in Colorrado surrounded by mountains. These mountains have the best skiing. The four skiing mountains in Aspen are Aspen Mountian, Highland Mountain, Snowmass, and Buttermilk. My favorite mounatin to ski on is Highlands. The town in Aspen is also fun because there are lots of restaurants and shops. One of my favorite restaurants in Aspen is Catch Steak, which is one of the newer restaurants. In the summer, there are lots of pretty biking trails to go on. Also, the REC center is a really fun place with a pool, rock climbing, and an ice skating rink. Aspen is a very fun, pretty town that has lots to do. 	</p>
