<h1>New York City and Southampton</h1>

<p>New York has two of my favorite places, NYC and Southampton. I've been going to both places ever since I was a baby and my dad's family lives there. New York City is full of everything and it has really fun shops, and museums. I've spent most of my time in New York with my grandmother at her apartment on the Upper East side. I also spend time in SoHo because it has really good shopping. </p>
